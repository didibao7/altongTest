msg_0443=Welcome to the knowledge sharing platform Altong!
msg_0444=Altong is an unprecedented, highly innovative knowledge platform that shares its profits based on intellectual activity. So it is recommended that you be sure to familiarize yourself with the following information before using the service. You will be able to use it better when you have the basic knowledge of the usage method, revenue sharing principle and glossary. (This user guide was last updated on May 27, 2021.)
msg_0445=Summary
msg_0446=Altong is a knowledge sharing platform developed and operated by Altong Inc. and made better by users(members). Unlike other similar services in the past, Altong is an innovative service that starts with the basic idea of&nbsp;
msg_0447=sharing profits with users&nbsp;
msg_0448=and provides reasonable financial rewards in the form of 'Al' to users who post questions or answers.
msg_0449=Revenue sharing principle
msg_0450=All revenue from Altong comes from the ad that appears before the answer is viewed. If a user who wants to view an answer presses Open, the entire answer can be viewed after an ad is displayed. And 1,000 Al paid for the ad by the advertiser is divided by a certain percentage among the questioner, the answerer, the answer evaluator, the referrers, Altong Inc., etc.
msg_0451=The revenue distribution ratio is as follows.
msg_0452=1,000 Al of the ad cost is distributed to
msg_0453=questioner: 100 Al
msg_0454=answerer: 500 Al
msg_0455=answer evaluator: 30 Al
msg_0456=questioner's referrer: 10 Al
msg_0457=answerer's referrer: 50 Al
msg_0458=Donation: 10 Al
msg_0459=Altong Inc.: 300 Al
msg_0460=In short, it can be said that the revenue generated from the ad is divided by the ratio of 7:3 between the user and Altong Inc.
msg_0461=Currently, the ratio is set as above, but it may be adjusted if a significant imbalance in member revenue is found or there is a change in advertising cost.
msg_0462=The service of Altong involves a financial process, so only the person who has verified his or her identity can be a member.
msg_0463=Before signing up as a member please read Terms of Use and agree to it, and then click 'Next' at the bottom to proceed to the signup page.
msg_0464=When signing up, you are required to enter the referral code. (If you sign up through the URL containing the referrer's code, the referral code will appear automatically entered.) The referral code&nbsp;
msg_0465=can be changed in 6 months if the requirements are met
msg_0466=.
msg_0467=Be sure to enter the referral code unless there is none.
msg_0468=After entering your mobile phone number, click 'Send verification number' to receive the verification number to your mobile phone. After completing verification, enter the required information in the fields and complete membership registration.
msg_0469=Newly registered members will be given&nbsp;
msg_0470=10,000 Al&nbsp;
msg_0471=for question posts. When your Al is exhausted, you cannot post a question and can only post answers. Al can be earned by Answer revenue earned when the posted answer is viewed by other members, ANSWERer revenue (10,000 Al per person) described below, etc.
msg_0472=Referral system
msg_0473=Altong is a platform that users fill with their knowledge and information, so if the number of users is small, it will be difficult to provide rich knowledge and information. For this reason, Altong introduces a referral system to provide special benefits to those who contributes to the new membership of Altong.
msg_0474=Referrer
msg_0475=A referrer means a member who introduced Altong to a non-member(referee) and led him or her to join.
msg_0476=The referral system is designed to help more people earn more profits through Altong.
msg_0477=10% of the revenue (Question revenue and Answer revenue) of the new member whose referrer is you goes to you. So the more people become members through you, the higher your revenue gets.
msg_0478=When you sign up through the URL sent by the referrer that contains his or her unique code, the referrer is automatically entered by the referral code.
msg_0479=After 6 months of sign-up, if your level is the same or higher than the referrer\u2019s level, the referral code can be changed.
msg_0480=You can check your unique code on Referral/ANSWERer page on the sliding menu on the left.
msg_0481=ANSWER(Altong Network System Worth Enthusiastic Referrals) is a unique system designed to invite more members to Altong and maximize members' revenue. And an ANSWERer means a member associated with you in the system.
msg_0482=In ANSWER, each time an ANSWERer associated with you is added, you will get&nbsp;
msg_0483=.
msg_0484=The ANSWERer is automatically arranged by the special algorithm developed by Altong.
msg_0485=ANSWER is a flexible campaign and is expected to be run until&nbsp;
msg_0486=October 10, 2021
msg_0487=.
msg_0488=Payment may be denied for ANSWERer profits acquired through abnormal methods.
msg_0489=The concepts of Al, stamp, Al exchange gauge and information on Al exchange and cash withdrawal
msg_0490=Al is a currency unit used in Altong, and&nbsp;
msg_0491=10 Al is worth KRW 1
msg_0492=.
msg_0493=One Al exchange gauge is filled once a week if the minimum activity requirements are met.
msg_0494=When all four gauges are filled, you can apply for Al exchange.
msg_0495=If the level is Butterfly Angel or above and the balance is&nbsp;
msg_0496=300,000 Al or more
msg_0497=&nbsp;you can apply for the first Al exchange. To maintain intellectual activity you should keep Al equivalent to 10% of the maximum exchangeable amount as the minimum balance.
msg_0498=Cash withdrawal can be applied for after going through the Al exchange process so that it can be used through our simple payment service Alpay. The money that has gone through the exchange process can be used just like cash by using Alpay in the offline affiliated stores called Almaengi, the nickname of the affiliated stores.
msg_0499=In the Al exchange process, the fee of 2.5% that is charged when paying at Almaengi, the Alpay member store is deducted in advance. (The deducted fee is used to alleviate small business owners' burden of payment fees and to expand the base of Alpay member stores.)
msg_0500=When applying for withdrawing the balance of Alpay in cash you will receive the amount after the income tax and residence tax of 3.3%, and withdrawal fee of 0.2%, a total of&nbsp;
msg_0501=&nbsp;is deducted from the application amount.
msg_0502=The minimum unit for applying for Al exchange is 10,000 Al, and the minimum unit for applying for withdrawal is KRW 1,000.
msg_0503=Cash withdrawal application is closed at 12:00 midnight every Sunday and remittance is processed by Thursday. (If Thursday is a public holiday, remittance will be processed the next day)
msg_0504=The rules for Al exchange by level are shown in the table below.
msg_0505=Member revenue
msg_0506=These are how members get revenue.
msg_0507=Question revenue is the revenue generated to the questioner when the answer to the questioner's question is viewed. Per view&nbsp;
msg_0508=100 Al
msg_0509=&nbsp;is given to the questioner. (As the number of answers increases, the number of views increases proportionally, so the questioner's revenue increases accordingly.)
msg_0510=Ex.) If an answer is posted and 500 people view the answer, 50,000 Al of revenue is generated to the questioner.
msg_0511=If there are 3 answers and 500 people view the answers 150,000 Al of revenue is generated.
msg_0512=If there are 5 answers and 500 people view the answers 250,000 Al is generated.
msg_0513=The number of question views does not necessarily mean the question revenue. In other words, if no answer is posted or if there are answers but no user views any of them then the questioner's revenue is not generated.
msg_0514=Answer revenue is the revenue generated to the answerer when his or her answer is viewed. Per view&nbsp;
msg_0515=500 Al
msg_0516=&nbsp;is given to the answerer.
msg_0517=Ex.) If 500 people view an answer 250,000 Al of revenue is generated to the answerer.
msg_0518=Gratitude Al revenue
msg_0519=Gratitude Al revenue is the revenue generated to the answerer when his or her answer is selected as the most satisfactory one by the questioner. Revenue is&nbsp;
msg_0520=100 Al minimum and 10,000 Al maximum
msg_0521=, depending on how much Al the questioner offers as Gratitude Al.
msg_0522=Referral revenue
msg_0523=Referral revenue means the revenue generated to the referrer when a user(referee) who has become a new member through the referrer's recommendation generates revenue by question (No. 1 above) and answer (No. 2 above). 
msg_0524= of the revenue will be paid to the referrer as referral revenue. In other words, if the referee earns the question revenue, the referrer is given&nbsp;
msg_0525=10 Al
msg_0526=, and if the referee gets the answer revenue, the referrer is paid&nbsp;
msg_0527=50 Al
msg_0528=. At this time, the referrer's revenue is paid by Altong Inc.&nbsp;
msg_0529=and the referee does not have any disadvantages in revenue
msg_0530=Ex.) If the referee earns 300,000 Al through No. 1 or 2 above, 30,000 Al is paid to the referrer.
msg_0531=Answer evaluation revenue
msg_0532=Answer evaluation revenue is the revenue given to the user who evaluates after viewing the answer, and&nbsp;
msg_0533=30 Al
msg_0534=&nbsp;is paid to the evaluator.
msg_0535=ANSWER revenue
msg_0536=Each time an ANSWERer associated with you is added in ANSWER, you will get 10,000 Al. Since ANSWER is a temporary policy, payments may be adjusted or terminated soon depending on circumstances.
msg_0537=Other revenues
msg_0538=Other revenues include Warming Al(Al given by other members as a token of gratitude) and prize Al paid when participating in events.
msg_0539=The best way to earn a lot of Al is to induce a large number of users to view your questions and answers by writing them with sincerity. Of course, the more questions and answers you post, the more your revenue will increase, won't it?
msg_0540=Questions that are of interest to many people can also induce a lot of views. For reference, there are questions that record millions of views as well as hundreds of thousands of views in a similar service. If the number of users increases a lot through active activities, the birth of high income earners will be realized sooner or later here in Altong :)
msg_0541=How to use
msg_0542=Search
msg_0543=Search for your questions. After entering keywords in the search box, press Move (Enter key in case of PC) or press the magnifying glass icon. If you have any related questions or answers click to browse.
msg_0544=Viewing answers
msg_0545=Posted answers will be shown partially on the screen first. You can view the entire answer after viewing the ad displayed by touching Open. For ads with links, a link button is displayed under the ad, so if you wish, you can touch the button to go to the advertiser's page. Ads disappear if you touch anywhere other than the link button.
msg_0546=In the case of viewing an answer without an ad,&nbsp;
msg_0547=1,000 Al will be deducted
msg_0548=, and an answer with an ad, you can view it&nbsp;
msg_0549=for free 
msg_0550=&nbsp;without deduction of Al.
msg_0551=There are questioner's choice answers and Angels' choice answers that have been highly evaluated by users who viewed the answers. When  you view an answer, it is highly likely that you will get a relatively satisfactory answer by viewing those answers first.
msg_0552=Answer evaluation
msg_0553=After viewing an answer please select one of the five evaluation icons and rate the quality of the answer in consideration of other users. If you view a fun answer, you can select Fun additionally except for the evaluation among the five. The evaluator is given&nbsp;
msg_0554=30 Al
msg_0555=Points are set for each evaluation icon. 7 points for Altong, 3 points for Good, 1 point for So so, -1 point for Bad, -3 points for Upset. (Currently Fun is 0, but some points may be given later.)
msg_0556=Member evaluation score can be reflected as one of the ascension requirements. The more sincerely you answer, the higher your score will be, so please answer sincerely.
msg_0557=Please actively participate in evaluation. Participation in evaluation is reflected in Evaluation Participation Index. If your index is low you can be adversely affected by  it when using various services in the future.
msg_0558=Please evaluate as carefully and objectively as possible. Ratings far from those of many other users may affect your reliability, which may adversely affect the smooth use of various services in the future.
msg_0559=Posting questions
msg_0560=If the search results for the desired question or answer are not found or you are not satisfied, you can press 'Post a question' or the pen icon and post one.
msg_0561=The questioner should select the most satisfactory answer from among answers and give the author of the answer some Al called Gratitude Al as a token of gratitude. For this, please select Gratitude Al to be paid. You can choose one of 100/300/500/1,000/5,000/10,000 Al for Gratitute Al to be paid. (The more Gratitude Al you offer, the more likely you are to get quick and satisfactory answers.)
msg_0562=If you do not want to disclose your nickname, you can post as Hidden, but in this case only&nbsp;
msg_0563=10 Al
msg_0564=, which is 10% of the question revenue, will be paid when revenue is generated.
msg_0565=Please note that your question cannot be modified or deleted after an answer is registered.
msg_0566=Selecting answers
msg_0567=Please choose the most satisfactory answer so that Gratitude Al will be given out. If no answer to the question is selected even after 10 days have elapsed since the question posting, the questioner will not be able to get question revenue(revenue from the answer to his or her question being viewed; revenue No. 1 above) from that point until an answer is selected. Only after an answer is adopted can you earn revenue again if any. (This system is intended to compensate for answerers' efforts and at the same time to prevent unsportsmanlike behavior by questioners who only get the answers they want and do not give out rewards.)
msg_0568=Posting answers
msg_0569=Since the placement order of posted answers is determined by summing the member evaluation points, the number of letters and received Warming Al, sincere answers are essential in order to put your answers to the top.
msg_0570=If you do not want to disclose your nickname, you can post as Hidden, but in this case only&nbsp;
msg_0571=50 Al
msg_0572=, which is 10% of the answer revenue, will be paid when revenue is generated.
msg_0573=If posted answers get good evaluations from users you can expect more answer revenue, and if it is adopted by the questioner, you can enjoy the bonus of receiving Gratitude Al. Therefore, when you post an answer accuracy is basic and it is recommended to write it in detail with as much elaboration as possible.
msg_0574=Please note that posted answers cannot be modified or deleted after they have been selected.
msg_0575=Ascension system
msg_0576=Altong has a unique level system. Active members increase in their level and can enjoy various benefits that members with lower levels cannot enjoy. This level-up is expressed by the word Ascension in Altong. The level automatically given after signing up is \u201CAl Angel\u201D. In order to ascend you need to meet the requirements listed below.
msg_0577=For the first Al exchange request you need to be Butterfly Angel level or above and the balance of Al Bank should be&nbsp;
msg_0578=300,000 Al
msg_0579=&nbsp;at least.
msg_0580=Stamp is given to members who meet the requirements and can be viewed on Achievements page.
msg_0581=For stamps there are 'Activity Mission Stamp', 'Company Training Stamp' and 'Referee Stamp'. Activity Mission Stamps are given to members who meet the activity requirements every week. Company Training Stamps are given to members who complete the online or offline training and Referee Stamps to members who meet the referee requirements.
msg_0582=Activity values are reset every Monday at 0 o'clock and you can get a stamp by completing the given activity mission by this time.
msg_0583=\u203B Among other requirements, 'assessment' refers to the review of posts, that is, questions, answers and comments. If a post is found that violates the policy of the service, the ascension may be withheld. In severe cases, there may be a disadvantage such as forced membership withdrawal, etc.
msg_0584=Copyright
msg_0585=Copyright is an extremely sensitive part. 
msg_0586=If a user's questions or answers infringe others' copyright, Altong Inc. is not responsible for any disadvantages that may arise from it
msg_0587=. In addition, sanctions can be taken for members who are found to have copyright infringement.
msg_0588=Membership withdrawal
